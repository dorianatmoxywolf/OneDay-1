# Explaining the Hunch Template

A hunch is a loosely-held assumption about a defined group of people, experiencing a common problem or pain point that you believe you can solve.

This framework evaluates a promising startup idea centered on helping founders validate their business concepts more effectively. All responses are affirmative, suggesting this idea warrants further exploration through customer interviews and problem validation.

The hunches and assessment draw directly from the principles outlined in the Lean Startup methodology, YC’s approach to startup ideation, and NFX’s frameworks for founder-market fit. They address the common challenges of idea validation, which according to the resources provided, is a primary reason startups fail - they build something nobody wants or needs.

## Core Problem

The first thing you’ll need to do is to identify the core problem you are trying to solve.

Then you’ll want to list at least three hunches to support your statement.

## Idea Assessment Framework

The Idea Assessment Framework presented in the hunch document is a systematic evaluation tool designed to determine whether a startup idea is worth pursuing further. This framework is grounded in the principles found in the Lean Startup methodology and various startup ideation approaches mentioned in your documents. Let me break down each component:

### 1. Customer Discovery

**“Can we affordably reach at least 20 target customers to interview given our current market presence?”**

This question addresses the practical feasibility of conducting customer research. According to the Lean Startup methodology, speaking directly with potential customers is essential for validating your assumptions before building anything substantial. Both Ash Maurya in “Running Lean” and Y Combinator emphasize that customer interviews are the foundation of idea validation. The specific number (20) provides a reasonable sample size that’s large enough to identify patterns while remaining manageable.

### 2. Problem Validation

**“Is the target customer currently paying to solve this problem?”**

This is perhaps the most crucial validation point in the framework. As highlighted in the research findings on Lean Startup principles, potential customers’ willingness to pay is one of the strongest indicators that a problem is genuinely painful enough to warrant a solution. If people are already spending money to solve this problem, even in suboptimal ways, it signals real market demand.

### 3. Gap in the Market

**“Have we identified a pain-point that is underserved?”**

This question builds on YC’s advice to look for problems that are significant but inadequately addressed. As mentioned in “The Ultimate Startup Ideation & Growth Playbook,” successful startups often identify “obvious inefficiencies” or processes that “seem needlessly complex or broken”. An underserved pain point suggests an opportunity for differentiation and value creation.

### 4. Demand Validation

**“Do we have the finances to reach this audience and test demand?”**

This practical question addresses resource constraints. The playbook emphasizes the importance of considering “cash as the oxygen of startups” and understanding your “path to profitability”. Before committing to an idea, you need confidence that you can afford the necessary testing and validation activities.

### 5. Solution Space

**“Can this problem be approached and solved in multiple ways?”**

This question examines the flexibility and potential for innovation. The research findings note that “The most successful startups evolve dramatically from their initial concepts.” A rich solution space allows for pivoting and iteration. If there’s only one narrow approach to solving the problem, you might get stuck if that approach doesn’t work.

### 6. Why Us?

**“Are you as a founder well-placed to solve this problem?”**

This question directly references the concept of “founder-market fit” highlighted in both the NFX articles and “The Ultimate Startup Ideation & Growth Playbook.” It examines whether your specific background, skills, network, and passions provide a unique advantage in addressing this problem. Strong founder-market fit significantly increases your chances of success.

## Purpose and Application

The framework serves several important purposes:

1.  **Structured Decision-Making**: It transforms subjective hunches into an objective assessment by examining specific criteria.

2.  **Risk Reduction**: By addressing these fundamental questions early, you follow the Lean Startup principle of “validating the riskiest assumptions first” before committing significant resources.

3.  **Prioritization**: When you have multiple hunches or ideas, this framework helps determine which ones have the highest potential. As noted in the “Warlords to Business Model Canvas” document, “simplicity and economy of force” are crucial for startups with limited resources.

4.  **Foundation for Further Validation**: A “Yes” across all questions doesn’t guarantee success, but it signals that the idea merits deeper investigation through customer interviews, prototype testing, and other lean validation techniques.

This framework embodies the core principle shared across your sources: that successful startups begin not with perfect ideas, but with systematic approaches to testing assumptions and learning from real customer feedback.

## Adding a Hypothesis

You should conclude your hunch document with a hypothesis because it forces clarity and accountability. Up to that point, you’re working with signals: emotions, patterns, frustrations, ideas that won’t go away. But a hypothesis turns that swirling intuition into a **testable statement**. It draws a line in the sand and says, “This is the bet I’m making about a specific group of people with a specific problem – and I’m ready to see if it holds up.” Without that final declaration, your hunch stays abstract. With it, you now have a clear direction for interviews, prototypes, and validation.

A good hypothesis also helps you **shift from belief to action**. It becomes the anchor point for designing experiments and customer discovery efforts. Instead of just brainstorming or theorizing, you now have something you can put in front of real people and ask, “Does this resonate? Does this solve something for you?” It frames your next steps not as guessing, but as learning. And that’s the core of the lean startup approach – reduce risk by testing assumptions early and often.

Additionally, the hypothesis acts like a **checkpoint for alignment**. It gives your team, mentors, or early collaborators something specific to challenge or support. They’re not responding to vague ideas or scattered thoughts – they’re reacting to a crisp statement of intent. This makes your early conversations more focused and your pivots more intentional. If the hypothesis turns out wrong, great – you’ve learned something valuable without building the wrong thing. If it turns out right, even better – you now have traction you can build on.

Ultimately, ending your hunch document with a hypothesis signals that you’re not just dreaming – you’re **committed to learning in public**. It marks the shift from founder-as-observer to founder-in-motion. And that’s the difference between having an idea and starting a company.
